                    <!--Post Content-->
                    <p>Apparently, it’s human nature to prefer curved lines over angular, straight lines and 
                        there are several studies to back that theory. One such study1 showed that when looking 
                        at curved lines, there was a general increase in the activity of the pleasure centers in 
                        the human brain, indicating that we might actually be hard-wired to feel happy when we 
                        look at curves. Another study2 that found a significantly higher preference for curves 
                        over sharp angles, theorized that it may be due to natural selection where sharp objects 
                        were more likely to trigger fear and feelings of being threatened in our ancestors, whereas 
                        curved outlines were viewed as being safe. Given 
                        the effect curved lines have on us, if you’ve been thinking about getting a new TV,
                         a curved TV versus flat might be a better option.</p>

                    <p>And it’s not just about how we feel about curves. The curves on our TVs are 
                        physically easier on the eyes as well. 
                        With the TV screen curving along with the natural curves of our eyes, 
                        the edges of the curved screen come into our field of vision and we’re 
                        able to see everything that’s on the screen. And as opposed to flat TVs, 
                        curved TV screens have less visual geometric distortion3 giving the added 
                        benefit of making watching TV less tiring 
                        on our eyes since they’re working less.4 To get an even better viewing experience, 
                        consider maintaining a good TV viewing distance. 5</p>

                        <p>Because of this wrap-around effect, we also get the sensation 
                            of actually being right there on the scene. The wider field of view 
                            enabled by the curves of the screen give it a panoramic effect which 
                            makes the TV screen itself seem larger than it is. With Samsung’s curved 
                            version of the ultra slim SUHD TVs, the curves have been engineered to 
                            form the optimal curvature for TV viewing, meaning that when the big games 
                            are on, you have the best seat in town. Just don’t forget to keep that 
                            optimal TV viewing distance.</p>

                            <p>Not only that, curved SUHD TVs come with Samsung’s proprietary Auto Depth Enhancer 
                                that deliver a greater sense of depth to the picture. So when you have the combination 
                                of the SUHD TV’s curves, Ultra HD technology and Samsung’s proprietary Auto Depth Enhancer 
                                at home, movie nights might never be the same again. What you see on the screen will feel 
                                so very real, you might even be reluctant to press play on that horror movie. When the action 
                                plunges you into free fall, you’ll need to hold on to your movie buddy or at least a cushion 
                                because when picture quality is this good, this real you’re in for a ride.</p>

                                <p>For one more reason why curves win when it’s a case of the curved TV versus flat: 
                                    the continual rise of curvy, wavy buildings in our cities. In an article6 that explored 
                                    the psychology of curvy architecture, a professor suggested it’s because curved buildings 
                                    can point to nature, while angular buildings contrast with it. Several articles7 and studies 
                                    suggest that curves create a sense of relief in our brains and stimulate the area referred 
                                    to as the pleasure center. And that could possibly be why getting a curved TV just might be 
                                    the most natural thing in the world to do.</p>
